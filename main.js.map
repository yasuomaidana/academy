Logic and Switches </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>The\nbasis of Aristotle's logic was the syllogism. In a syllogism, two\npremises are assumed to be correct, and from these a conclusion is\ndeduced.</P>\n<P>In\nconventional algebra, the operands (which are usually letters) stand\nfor numbers, and the operators (most often + and x) indicate how\nthese numbers are to be combined.</P>\n<P>The\nfirst rule is that addition and multiplication are commutative.</P>\n<P>By\ncontrast, subtraction and division are not commutative. Addition and\nmultiplication are also associative, multiplication is said to be\ndistributive over addition.</P>\n<P>It\nwas Boole's genius to make algebra more abstract by divorcing it from\nconcepts of number.</P>\n<P>In\nBoolean algebra (as Boole's algebra was eventually called), the\noperands refer not to numbers but instead to classes.</P>\n<P>A\nclass is simply a group of things, what in later times came to be\nknown as a set.</P>\n<P>In\nconventional (numeric) algebra, the operators + and x are used to\nindicate addition and multiplication. In Boolean algebra, the same +\nand x symbols are used, and here's where things might get confusing.\nEverybody knows how to add and multiply numbers in conventional\nalgebra, but how do we add and multiply classes?</P>\n<P>The\n+ symbol in Boolean algebra means a union of two classes. A union of\ntwo classes is everything in the first class combined with everything\nin the second class.</P>\n<P>The\nx symbol in Boolean algebra means an intersection of two classes. An\nintersection of two classes is everything that is in both the first\nclass and the second class.</P>\n<P>To\navoid confusion between conventional algebra and Boolean algebra,\nsometimes the symbols U and ∩ are used for union and intersection\ninstead of + and x.</P>\n<P>The\ncommutative, associative, and distributive rules all hold for Boolean\nalgebra.</P>\n<P>What's\nmore, in Boolean algebra the + operator is distributive over the x\noperator. This isn't true of conventional algebra:</P>\n<P>The\nsymbol 1 in Boolean algebra means &quot;the universe&quot;—that is,\neverything we're talking about.</P>\n<P>The\n1 symbol can be used with a minus sign to indicate the universe\nexcluding something.</P>\n<P>The\nother symbol that we need is the 0, and in Boolean algebra the 0\nmeans an empty class—a class of nothing.</P>\n<P>The\nempty class results when we take an intersection of two mutually\nexclusive classes,</P>\n<P>It's\ncalled the Law of Contradiction and indicates that something can't be\nboth itself and the opposite of itself.</P>\n<P>Boolean\nalgebra provides a mathematical method for solving the syllogisms of\nAristotle.</P>\n<P>but\nBoolean algebra can also be used to determine whether something\nsatisfies a certain set of criteria.</P>\n<P>In\naddition, you can use the word NOT wherever you see a 1 followed by a\nminus sign.</P>\n<P>The\n+ (previously known as a union) now means OR. The x (previously known\nas an intersection) now means AND. The 1 – (previously the universe\nwithout something) now means NOT.</P>\n<P>With\nthis formula written down, the salesperson can perform something\ncalled a Boolean test. Without making a big fuss about it, I've\nsubtly shifted to a somewhat different form of Boolean algebra. In\nthis form of Boolean algebra, letters no longer refer to classes.\nInstead, the letters can now be assigned numbers.</P>\n<P>The\nnumeral 1 means Yes, True, this particular cat satisfies these\ncriteria. The numeral 0 means No, False, this cat doesn't satisfy\nthese criteria.</P>\n<P>While\nwe're simplifying the expression, keep in mind that we're not really\nadding and multiplying, although generally we can pretend that we\nare. Most of the same rules apply when + means OR and x means AND.\n(Sometimes in modern texts the symbols ^ and ν are used for AND and\nOR instead of x and +. But here's where the + and x signs perhaps\nmake the most sense.)</P>\n<P>Not\neven that icon of the computer revolution Charles Babbage\n(1792–1871), who had corresponded with Boole and knew his work, and\nwho struggled for much of his life designing first a Difference\nEngine and then an Analytical Engine that a century later would be\nregarded as the precursors to modern computers.</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> 11.

All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge.</P>\n<P>Elaboration\nis the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in\nyour own words and connecting it with what you already know.</P>\n<P>Putting\nnew knowledge into a larger context helps learning. \n</P>\n<P>People\nwho learn to extract the key ideas from new material and organize\nthem into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge\nshow an advantage in learning complex mastery. \n</P>\n<P>A\nmental model is a mental representation of some external reality.</P>\n<P>But\nevery time you learn something new, you change the brain— the\nresidue of your experiences is stored. \n</P>\n<P>Rereading\nhas three strikes against it. It is time consuming. It doesn’t\nresult in durable memory. And it often involves a kind of unwitting\nself- deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel\nlike mastery of the content. \n</P>\n<P>Learning\nis stronger when it matters, when the abstract is made concrete and\npersonal.</P>\n<P>“The\nkey to learning something well is repetition; the more times you go\nover the material the better chance you have of storing it\npermanently.” This tactic might work when looking up a phone number\nand holding it in your mind while punching it into your phone, but it\ndoesn’t work for durable learning.</P>\n<P>Recall.\nMere repetition did not enhance learning. Subsequent, it makes sense\nto reread a text once if there’s been a meaningful lapse of time\nsince the first reading, but doing multiple readings in close\nsuccession is a time- consuming study strategy that yields negligible\nbenefits at the expense of much more effective strategies that take\nless time.</P>\n<P>However,\nrepeated reading provides the illusion of mastery of the underlying\nideas.

In memory, Aristotle wrote: “exercise in\nrepeatedly recalling a thing strengthens the memory.” \n</P>\n<P>To\nbe most effective, retrieval must be repeated again and again, in\nspaced out sessions so that the recall, rather than becoming a\nmindless recitation, requires some cognitive effort. \n</P>\n<P>Repeated\nrecall appears to help memory consolidate into a cohesive\nrepresentation in the brain and to strengthen and multiply the neural\nroutes by which the knowledge can later be retrieved. In repeated\nretrieval can so embed knowledge and skills that they become\nreflexive: the brain acts before the mind has time to decide</P>\n<P>Researchers\nfound that massed studying (cramming) leads to higher scores on an\nimmediate test but results in faster forgetting compared to\npracticing retrieval. \n</P>\n<P>Thus,\nand in agreement with later research, multiple sessions of retrieval\npractice are generally better than one, especially if the test\nsessions are spaced out.</P>\n<P>When\nretrieval practice is spaced, allowing some forgetting to occur\nbetween tests, it leads to stronger long-term retention than when it\nis massed.</P>\n<P>The\nsimple act of exposing them to the material in the quizzes was\nresponsible for the superior learning, not the retrieval practice. \n</P>\n<P>Studies\nshow that giving feedback strengthens retention more than testing\nalone does, and, interestingly, some evidence shows that delaying the\nfeedback briefly produces better long-term learning than immediate\nfeedback. \n</P>\n<P>In\nmotor learning, trial and error with delayed feedback is a more\nawkward but effective way of acquiring a skill than trial and\ncorrection through immediate feedback; the learner quickly comes to\ndepend on the continued presence of the correction.</P>\n<P>Even\na single test in a class can produce a large</P>\n<P>Improvement\nin final exam scores, and gains in learning continue to increase as\nthe number of tests increases.14 Whichever theories science\neventually tells us are correct about how repeated retrieval\nstrengthens memory, empirical research shows us that the testing\neffect is real— that the act of retrieving a memory changes the\nmemory, making it easier to retrieve again later.</P>\n<P>Is\nrepeated testing simply a way to expedite rote learning? In fact,\nresearch indicates that testing, compared to rereading, can\nfacilitate better transfer of knowledge to new contexts and problems,\nand that it improves one’s ability to retain and retrieve material\nthat is related but not tested. Further research is needed on this\npoint, but it seems that retrieval practice can make information more\naccessible when it is needed in various contexts.</P>\n<P>After\na test, students spend more time restudying the material they missed,\nand they learn more from it than do their peers who restudy the\nmaterial without having been tested. Students whose study strategies\nemphasize rereading but not self-testing show over-confidence in\ntheir mastery. Students who have been quizzed have a double advantage\nover those who have not: a more accurate sense of what they know and\ndon’t know, and the strengthening of learning that accrues from\nretrieval practice.</P>\n<P>Frequent\nlow- stakes testing helps dial down test anxiety among students by\ndiversifying the consequences over a much larger sample.</P>\n<P>Practice\nat retrieving new knowledge or skill from memory is a potent tool for\nlearning and durable retention. This is true for anything the brain\nis asked to remember and call up again in the future— facts,\ncomplex concepts, problem-solving techniques, motor skills.</P>\n<P>Effortful\nretrieval makes for stronger learning and retention. \n</P>\n<P>When\nthe mind has to work, learning sticks better. The greater the effort\nto retrieve learning, provided that you succeed, the more that\nlearning is strengthened by retrieval. \n</P>\n<P>Repeated\nretrieval not only makes memories more durable but produces knowledge\nthat can be retrieved more readily, in more varied settings, and\napplied to a wider variety of problems.</P>\n<P>While\ncramming can produce better scores on an immediate exam, the\nadvantage quickly fades because there is much greater forgetting\nafter rereading than after retrieval practice.</P>\n<P>Simply\nincluding one test (retrieval practice) in a class yields a large\nimprovement in fi nal exam scores, and gains continue to increase as\nthe frequency of classroom testing increases.</P>\n<P>Self-testing\nmay be unappealing because it takes more effort than rereading, but\nas noted already, the greater the effort at retrieval, the more will\nbe retained.</P>\n<P>Giving\nstudents corrective feedback after tests keeps them from incorrectly\nretaining material they have misunderstood and produces better\nlearning of the correct answers.</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> 3.

Testing is not only a powerful learning strategy; it is a\npotent reality check on the accuracy of your own judgment of what you\nknow how to do. When confidence is based on repeated performance,\ndemonstrated through testing that simulates real-world conditions,\nyou can lean into it. \n</P>\n<H2>How Learning Occurs</H2>\n<P>Encoding</P>\n<P>The\nbrain converts your perceptions into chemical and electrical changes\nthat form a mental representation of the patterns you’ve observed.\nThis process of converting sensory perceptions into meaningful\nrepresentations in the brain is still not perfectly understood. We\ncall the process encoding, and we call the new representations within\nthe brain memory traces. \n</P>\n<P>Consolidation</P>\n<P>The\nprocess of strengthening these mental representations for long-term\nmemory is called consolidation. New learning is labile: its meaning\nis not fully formed and therefore is easily altered. In\nconsolidation, the brain reorganizes and stabilizes the memory\ntraces. This may occur over several hours or longer and involves deep\nprocessing of the new material, during which scientists believe that\nthe brain replays or rehearses the learning, giving it meaning,\nfilling in blank spots, and making connections to past experiences\nand to other knowledge already stored in long-term memory. Prior\nknowledge is a prerequisite for making sense of new learning, and\nforming those connections is an important task of consolidation. As\nwe’ve noted, sleep seems to help memory consolidation, but in any\ncase, consolidation and transition of learning to long- term storage\noccurs over a period of time.</P>\n<P>Retrieval\nLearning</P>\n<P>Remembering,\nand forgetting work together in interesting ways. Durable, robust\nlearning requires that we do two things. First, as we recode and\nconsolidate new material from short-term memory into long-term\nmemory, we must anchor it there securely. Second, we must associate\nthe material with a diverse set of cues that will make us adept at\nrecalling the knowledge later. Having effective retrieval cues is an\naspect of learning that often goes overlooked. The task is more than\ncommitting knowledge to memory. Being able to retrieve it when we\nneed it is just as important.</P>\n<P>Knowledge,\nskills, and experiences that are vivid and hold significance, and\nthose that are periodically practiced, stay with us. If mind. Context\ncan unleash memories, as when the right key works to open an old\nlock. In other words, the more you’ve forgotten about a topic, the\nmore effective relearning will be in shaping your permanent\nknowledge.9</P>\n<P>Reconsolidating\n</P>\n<P>Memory\nEffortful recall of learning, as happens in spaced practice, requires\nthat you “reload” or reconstruct the components of the skill or\nmaterial anew from long-term memory rather than mindlessly repeating\nthem from short-term memory.10 During this focused, effortful recall,\nthe learning is made pliable again: the most salient aspects of it\nbecome clearer, and the consequent reconsolidation helps to reinforce\nmeaning, strengthen connections to prior knowledge, bolster the cues\nand retrieval routes for recalling it later, and weaken competing\nroutes.</P>\n<P>Spaced\npractice</P>\n<P>Allows\nsome forgetting to occur between sessions, strengthens both the\nlearning and the cues and routes for fast retrieval when that\nlearning is needed again, as when the pitcher tries to surprise the\nbatter with a curveball after pitching several fastballs. It is\nrequired to recall a memory or to execute a skill, provided that the\neffort succeeds, the more the act of recalling or executing benefits\nthe learning.</P>\n<P>Creating\nMental Models \n</P>\n<P>With\nenough effortful practice, a complex set of interrelated ideas or a\nsequence of motor skills fuse into a meaningful whole, forming a\nmental model somewhat akin to a “brain app”. \n</P>\n<P>Mental\nmodels \n</P>\n<P>Are\nforms of deeply entrenched and highly efficient skills (seeing and\nun-loading on a curveball) or knowledge structures (a memorized\nsequence of chess moves) that, like habits, can be adapted and\napplied in varied circumstances.</P>\n<P>Broadening\nMastery Retrieval practice that you perform at different times and in\ndifferent contexts and that interleaves different learning material\nhas the benefit of linking new associations to the material. This\nprocess builds interconnected networks of knowledge that bolster and\nsupport mastery of your fi eld. It also multiplies the cues for\nretrieving the knowledge, increasing the versatility with which you\ncan later apply it.</P>\n<P>Fostering\nConceptual Learning</P>\n<P>It’s\nthought that this heightened sensitivity to similarities and\ndifferences during interleaved practice leads to the encoding of more\ncomplex and nuanced representations of the study material— a better\nunderstanding of how specimens or types of problems are distinctive\nand why they call for a different interpretation or solution.</P>\n<P>Improving\nVersatility call transfer of learning, which is the ability to apply\nwhat you’ve learned in new settings.</P>\n<P>Priming\nthe Mind for Learning \n</P>\n<P>When\nyou’re asked to struggle with solving a problem before being shown\nhow to solve it, the subsequent solution is better learned and more\ndurably remembered.</P>\n<P>Other\nLearning Strategies \n</P>\n<P>Incorporates\ndesirable difficulties we usually think of interference as a\ndetriment to learning, but certain kinds of interference can produce\nlearning benefits, and the positive effects are sometimes surprising.</P>\n<P>The\nact of trying to answer a question or attempting to solve a problem\nrather than being presented with the information or the solution is\nknown as generation.</P>\n<P>In\ntesting, being required to supply an answer rather than select from\nmultiple choice options often provides stronger learning benefits.\nHaving</P>\n<P>The\nact of taking a few minutes to review what has been learned from an\nexperience</P>\n<P>and\nasking yourself questions is known as reflection.</P>\n<P>Reflection\ncan involve several cognitive activities we have discussed that lead\nto stronger learning. These include retrieval (recalling recently\nlearned knowledge to mind), elaboration (for example, connecting new\nknowledge to what you already know), and generation (for example,\nrephrasing key ideas in your own words or visualizing and mentally\nrehearsing what you might do differently next time).</P>\n<P>One\nform of reflection that is gaining currency in classroom settings is\ncalled “write to learn.”</P>\n<P>Even\nstrategies that are highly likely to result in errors, like asking\nsomeone to try to solve a problem before being shown how to do it,\nproduce stronger learning and retention of the correct information\nthan more passive learning strategies, provided there is corrective\nfeedback. Moreover, people who are taught that learning is a struggle\nthat often involves making errors will go on to exhibit a greater\npropensity to tackle tough challenges and will tend to see mistakes\nnot as failures but as lessons and turning points along the path to\nmastery.</P>\n<P>A\nfear of failure can poison learning by creating aversions to the\nkinds of experimentation and risk taking that characterize striving,\nor by diminishing performance under pressure, as in a test setting.</P>\n<P>It\nseems that a significant portion of their working memory capacity is\nexpended to monitor their performance leaving less working memory\ncapacity available to solve the problems posed by the test. “Working\nmemory” refers to the amount of information you can hold in mind\nwhile working through a problem, especially in the face of\ndistraction. Everyone’s working memory is severely limited, some\nmore than others, and larger working memory capacities correlate with\nhigher IQs.</P>\n<P>Not\nall difficulties in learning are desirable ones. Anxiety while taking\na test seems to represent an undesirable difficulty. \n</P>\n<P>To\nbe desirable, a difficulty must be something learners can overcome\nthrough increased effort.</P>\n<P>Learning\nis at least a three-step process: initial encoding of information is\nheld in short-term working memory before being consolidated into a\ncohesive representation of knowledge in long-term memory.\nConsolidation reorganizes and stabilizes memory traces, gives them\nmeaning, and makes connections to past experiences and to other\nknowledge already stored in long-term memory. Retrieval updates\nlearning and enables you to apply it when you need it.</P>\n<P>Learning\nalways builds on a store of prior knowledge. We interpret and\nremember events by building connections to what we already know.</P>\n<P>Long-term\nmemory capacity is virtually limitless: the more you know, the more\npossible connections you have for adding new knowledge.</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> 5. Avoid Illusions of Knowing </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>Monitoring\nyour own thinking is what psychologists call metacognition</P>\n<P>\nLearning\nto be accurate self-observers helps us to stay out of blind alleys,\nmake good decisions, and reflect on how we might do better next time.\nAn important part of this skill is being sensitive to the ways we can\ndelude ourselves. One problem with poor judgment is that we usually\ndon’t know when we’ve got it.</P>\n<P>The\ntruth is that we’re all hardwired to make errors in judgment. Good\njudgment is a skill one must acquire, becoming an astute observer of\none’s own thinking and performance. We start at a disadvantage for\nseveral reasons. One is that when we’re incompetent, we tend to\noverestimate our competence and see little reason to change. Another\nis that, as humans, we are readily misled by illusions, cognitive\nbiases, and the stories we construct to explain the world around us\nand our place within it. To become more competent, or even expert, we\nmust learn to recognize competence when we see it in others, become\nmore accurate judges of what we ourselves know and don’t know,\nadopt learning strategies that get results, and find objective ways\nto track our progress.</P>\n<H2>Two Systems of Knowing</H2>\n<P>System\n1 (or the automatic system) is unconscious, intuitive, and immediate.\nIt draws on our senses and memories to size up a situation in the\nblink of an eye. It’s the running back dodging tackles in his dash\nfor the end zone. \n</P>\n<P>System\n2 (the controlled system) is our slower process of conscious analysis\nand reasoning. It’s the part of thinking that considers choices,\nmakes decisions, and exerts self-control.</P>\n<P>We\nalso use it to train System 1 to recognize and respond to par tic u\nlar situations that demand reflexive action. The</P>\n<P>System\n1 is automatic and deeply influential, but it is susceptible to\nillusion, and you depend on System 2 to help you manage yourself: by\nchecking your impulses, planning ahead, identifying choices, thinking\nthrough their implications, and staying in charge of your actions.\nWhen System 1 is powerful because it draws on our accumulated years\nof experience and our deep emotions. System 1 gives us the survival\nreflex in moments of danger, and the astonishing deftness earned\nthrough thousands of hours of deliberate practice in a chosen fi eld\nof expertise. In the interplay between Systems 1 and 2— your\ninstantaneous ability to size up a situation plays against your\ncapacity for skepticism and thoughtful analysis. Of Learning when to\ntrust your intuition and when to question it is a big part of how you\nimprove your competence in the world at large and in any fi eld where\nyou want to be expert.</P>\n<P>There\nare many ways that our System 1 and System 2 judgments can be led\nastray: perceptual illusions faulty narrative, distortions of memory,\nfailure to recognize when a new kind of problem requires a new kind\nof solution, and a variety of cognitive biases to which we’re\nprone.</P>\n<P>Our\nunderstanding of the world is shaped by a hunger for narrative that\nrises out of our discomfort with ambiguity and arbitrary events. When\nsurprising things happen, we search for an explanation. The urge to\nresolve ambiguity can be surprisingly potent, even when the subject\nis inconsequential. In</P>\n<P>We\nstrive to fi t the events of our lives into a cohesive story that\naccounts for our circumstances, the things that befall us, and the\nchoices we make. Each of us has a different narrative that has many\nthreads woven into it from our shared culture and experience of being\nhuman, as well as many distinct threads that explain the singular\nevents of one’s personal</P>\n<P>All\nthese experiences influence what comes to mind in a current situation\nand the narrative through which you make sense of it: Why</P>\n<P>The\nmemories we organize meaningfully become those that are better\nremembered. Narrative provides not only meaning but also a Avoid\nmental framework for imbuing future experiences and information with\nmeaning, in effect shaping new memories to fi t our established\nconstructs of the world and ourselves. \n</P>\n<P>Thus,\nthe narrative of memory becomes central to our intuitions regarding\nthe judgments we make and the actions we take.</P>\n<P>Memory\nis a reconstruction. We cannot remember every aspect of an event, so\nwe remember those elements that have greatest emotional significance\nfor us, and we fill in the gaps with details of our own that are\nconsistent with our narrative but may be wrong. People remember\nthings that were implied but not specifically stated. \n</P>\n<P>Imagination\ninflation refers to the tendency of people who, when asked to imagine\nan event vividly, will sometimes begin to believe, when asked about\nit later, that the event actually occurred. \n</P>\n<P>Another\ntype of memory illusion is one caused by suggestion, which may arise\nsimply in the way a question is asked.</P>\n<P>\nWhat\npsychologists call the curse of knowledge is our tendency to\nunderestimate how long it will take another person to learn something\nnew or perform a task that we have already mastered. \n</P>\n<P>\nHumans\nare predisposed to assume that others share their beliefs, a process\ncalled the false consensus effect.</P>\n<P>As\nyou get more expert in complex areas, your models in those areas grow\nmore complex, and the component steps that compose them fade into the\nbackground of memory</P>\n<P>Incompetent\npeople lack the skills to improve because they are unable to\ndistinguish between incompetence and competence.</P>\n<P>Their\nresearch showed that incompetent people overestimate their own\ncompetence and, failing to sense a mismatch between their performance\nand what is desirable, see no need to try to improve. \n</P>\n<P>Incompetent\npeople can be taught to raise their competence by learning the skills\nto judge their own performance more accurately, in short, to make\ntheir metacognition more accurate. \n</P>\n<P>Most\nimportant is to make frequent use of testing and retrieval practice\nto verify what you really do know versus what you think you know.</P>\n<P>In\nmany settings, your judgment and learning are calibrated by working\nalongside a more experienced partner</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> 6.

Fluid intelligence is the ability to reason, see\nrelationships, think abstractly, and hold information in mind while\nworking on a problem; crystallized intelligence is one’s\naccumulated knowledge of the world and the procedures or mental\nmodels one has developed from past learning and experience.

Increase Your Abilities </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>Memory.\nMnemonic devices are mental tools that can take many forms but\ngenerally are used to help hold a large volume of new material in\nmemory, cued for ready recall.</P>\n<P>The\nneurons sprout microscopic branches, called axons, that reach out in\nsearch of tiny nubs on other neurons, called dendrites. When axon\nmeets dendrite, a synapse is formed. In order for some axons to find\ntheir target dendrites they must travel vast distances to complete\nthe connections that make up our neural circuitry. It’s this\ncircuitry that enables our senses, cognition, and motor skills,\nincluding learning and memory, and it is this circuitry that forms\nthe possibilities and the limits of one’s intellectual capacity.</P>\n<P>Neural\ncell bodies make up most of the part of our brains that scientists\ncall the gray matter. What they call the white matter is made up of\nthe wiring: the axons that connect to dendrites of other neural cell\nbodies, and the waxy myelin sheaths in which some axons are wrapped,\nlike the plastic coating on a lamp cord.</P>\n<P>This\nstudy showed what others have suggested, that the speed of our mental\nabilities is determined by the robustness of our neural connections;\nthat this robustness, at the initial stages, is largely determined by\nour genes, but that our neural circuitry does not mature as early as\nour physical development and instead continues to change and grow\nthrough our forties, fifties, and sixties. Part of the maturation of\nthese connections is the gradual thickening of the myelin coating of\nthe axons. Myelination generally starts at the backs of our brains\nand moves toward the front, reaching the frontal lobes as we grow\ninto adulthood. The frontal lobes perform the executive functions of\nthe brain and are the location of the processes of reasoning and\njudgment, skills that are developed through experience. The thickness\nof the myelin coating correlates with ability, and research strongly\nsuggests that increased practice builds greater myelin along the\nrelated pathways, improving the strength and speed of the electrical\nsignals and, as a result, performance. Increases neuroplasticity. The\nneural circuits we use when we take conscious action toward a goal\nare not the same ones we use when our actions have become automatic,\nthe result of habit. The actions we take by habit are directed from a\nregion located deeper in the brain, the basal ganglia. When we engage\nin extended training and repetition of some kinds of learning,\nnotably motor skills and sequential tasks, our learning is thought to\nbe recoded in this deeper region, the same area that controls\nsubconscious actions such as eye movements. As a part of this process\nof recoding, the brain is thought to chunk motor and cognitive action\nsequences together so that they can be performed as a single unit,\nthat is, without requiring a series of conscious decisions, which\nwould substantially slow our responses. These sequences become\nreflexive. \n</P>\n<P>Another\nfundamental sign of the brain’s enduring mutability is the\ndiscovery that the hippocampus, where we consolidate learning and\nmemory, is able to generate new neurons throughout life. This\nphenomenon, called neurogenesis, is thought to play a central role in\nthe brain’s ability to recover from physical injury and in humans’\nlifelong ability to learn. The that the activity of associative\nlearning stimulates an increase in the creation of new neurons in the\nhippocampus. This rise in neurogenesis starts before the new learning\nactivity is undertaken, suggesting the brain’s intention to learn,\nand continues for a period after the learning activity, suggesting\nthat neurogenesis plays a role in the consolidation of memory and the\nbeneficial effects that spaced and effortful retrieval practice have\non long-term retention.</P>\n<P>A\nkey determiner of fluid intelligence is the capacity of a person’s\nworking memory— the number of new ideas and relationships that a\nperson can hold in mind while working through a problem.</P>\n<P>The\nbrain is not a muscle, so strengthening one skill does not\nautomatically strengthen others. Learning and memory strategies such\nas retrieval practice and the building of mental models are effective\nfor enhancing intellectual abilities in the material or skills\npracticed, but the benefits don’t extend to mastery of other\nmaterial or skills. \n</P>\n<P>To\nthe extent that “brain training” improves one’s efficacy and\nself-confidence, as the purveyors claim, the benefits are more likely\nthe fruits of better habits, such as learning how to focus attention\nand persist at practice.</P>\n<P>People\nwith performance goals unconsciously limit their potential. But if\nyour goal is to increase your ability, you pick ever-increasing\nchallenges, and you interpret setbacks as useful information that\nhelps you to sharpen your focus, get more creative, and work harder. \n</P>\n<P>A\nmemory palace is a more complex type of mnemonic device that is\nuseful for organizing and holding larger volumes of material in\nmemory. It’s based on the method of loci, which goes back to the\nancient Greeks and involves associating mental images with a series\nof physical locations to help cue memories. \n</P>\n<P>Mnemonic\ndevices are sometimes discounted as tricks of memory, not tools that\nfundamentally add to learning, and in a sense this is correct. The\nvalue of mnemonics to raise intellectual abilities comes after\nmastery of new material, as handy mental pockets for fi ling what\nthey’ve learned, and linking the main ideas in each pocket to vivid\nmemory cues so that they can readily bring them to mind and retrieve\nthe associated concepts and details, in depth, at the unexpected\nmoments that the need arises.</P>\n<P>With\ncontinued retrieval, complex material can become second nature to a\nperson and the mnemonic cues are no longer needed through repeated\nuse, your brain encodes and “chunks” sequences of motor and\ncognitive actions, and your ability to recall and apply them becomes\nas automatic as habit.</P>\n<P>Effortful\nlearning changes the brain, building new connections and capability.\nThis single fact— that our intellectual abilities are not fixed\nfrom birth but are, to a considerable degree, ours to shape— is\ndoing. The more we do, the more we can do. To embrace this principle\nand reap its benefits is to be sustained through life by a growth\nmindset.</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> 8.

We could end with the premise that there were two groups of people: the ones that sense intense connections and the others that not. The variable that separates those who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who struggle for it is that the first group believes that they deservers it, and they are worthy.</p>\n        <p>However, the first group feels vulnerable. Nevertheless, they believe that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful too. </p>  \n        <p>We have to be very aware of numbing the vulnerability.

You must understand your client and customer before doing anything. The main reason, sometimes you got stuck into a specific way of solving a problem, maybe for a technical or even a personal motive. However, if you understand what your client wants, behaves, and senses, you could find a better solution. \n        </p>\n        <p>Then the other recommendations were focused on project implementation, for example, doing good comments and documentation and finding a team motivated with the goal. \n        </p>\n        <h2>Microservices</h2>\n        <p>We could define them as a collection of independent tools that helps you to develop a project. They have several pros and cons, which are very related. As the number of tools increases, the network information becomes more complex. The advantage of using independent tools rely on the fact that you could modify, maintain and test without affecting all the system you already have. \n        </p>\n        <h2>Apprentice path </h2>\n        <p>In the last speech, the topic was how to become a good apprentice. I found this talk appropriate for any context. Because it doesn’t matter which discipline you choose, if you believe that you have mastered it, you couldn’t grow up anymore in that field. The reason, you can only bloom as you are concern about your scope beyond. \n        </p>\n        <p>In few words, you have to be humble to recognize you can develop.

Using a range allows the tool to pick a\nsuitable version for the build. Continuing the example with Guava, if\nyou know that any version between 12.0 and up to 15.0 (excluded)\nwould work, you could define it as “[12.0,15.0)”. You can also\nleave it open-ended like “[12.0,)”, which adds a requirement for\nany version from 12.0 and up, similarly “(,12.0]” would be any\nversion up to and including 12.0. Or if you want anything higher than\n12.0, except for version 13.0, you could specify\n“[12.0,13.0),(13.0,)” as the version.</P>\n<P>Besides\nranges and specific versions, dependencies can also be resolved using\ndynamic versions by using the keywords ‘LATEST’ or ‘RELEASE’\ninstead of the version number. \n</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> Mocks Aren't Stubs </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>'Mock\nObjects’: special case objects that mimic real objects for testing.</P>\n<P><B>Regular\nTests</B></P>\n<P>xUnit\ntests follow a typical four phase sequence: setup, exercise, verify,\nteardown. \n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>In\nthis case the setup phase is done partly in the setUp method (setting\nup the warehouse) and partly in the test method (setting up the\norder).

For a start it's\ndivided into two parts: data and expectations. The data part sets up\nthe objects we are interested in working with, in that sense it's\nsimilar to the traditional setup. The difference is in the objects\nthat are created. The SUT is the same - an order. however the\ncollaborator isn't a warehouse object, instead it's a mock warehouse\n- technically an instance of the class Mock.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>The\nsecond part of the setup creates expectations on the mock object.The\nexpectations indicate which methods should be called on the mocks\nwhen the SUT is exercised.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>Once\nall the expectations are in place I exercise the SUT. After the\nexercise I then do verification, which has two aspects. I run asserts\nagainst the SUT - much as before. however I also verify the mocks -\nchecking that they were called according to their expectations.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>Mocks\nuse <B>behavior\nverification</B>,\nwhere we instead check to see if the order made the correct calls on\nthe warehouse. We do this check by telling the mock what to expect\nduring setup and asking the mock to verify itself during\nverification. Only the order is checked using asserts, and if the\nmethod doesn't change the state of the order there's no asserts at\nall.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<h2 >The Difference Between Mocks\nand Stubs</h2>\n<P>Using\nmocks is one way to not use a real warehouse in the test, but there\nare other forms of unreal objects used in testing like this.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>Test\nDouble: the generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place\nof a real object for testing purposes.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>Types\nof double:</P>\n<UL>\n\t<LI><P><B>Dummy</B>\n\tobjects are passed around but never actually used.

Mocks\nactually do behave like other doubles during the exercise phase, as\nthey need to make the SUT believe it's talking with its real\ncollaborators - but mocks differ in the setup and the verification\nphases.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> Xunit </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>It was inspiring see how something that born as a small project done without bigger purposes ended as an industry standard</P>\n\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n\n\n<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> UnitTest </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <P>Firstly\nthere is a notion that unit tests are low-level, focusing on a small\npart of the software system.

Although I start with the notion of the unit being a class,\nI often take a bunch of closely related classes and treat them as a\nsingle unit.

Pretotyping is about trying a lot of ideas,\ntranslated into fast failures, increasing probabilities to find a\nsuccessful idea. In this case, we began by discussing different ideas\nas a group and we filtered them through the question: “Would we use\nit?”. \n</P>\n<P>Finally,\nwhen we answered yes to the three ideas we moved one to the next\nstage, working the pretotyping. In the next sections, you will be\nable to see our hypothesis and next if they were correct or not. \n</P>\n<P>Once\nthe ideas were decided, the next thing to do was finding our\npretotyping, in our case we decided it was a good idea to create fake\nads about the ideas and gather data about how many people would\nactually voluntarily click on the ad. \n</P>\n<P>Here\nare the ads we used: \n</P>\n<H3>Courselet</H3>\n<P>Click\nhere if you would like to track the price and get recommendations of\ncourses on any platform (e. g. Coursera, edx, udemy, udacity…) in a\nsingle place without having to visit other platforms separately and\nbe aware of the discounts in your courses.</P>\n<H3>Gastracker - Gas price tracker</H3>\n<P>Are\nyou interested to know which fuel station in your city has the better\nprices so you can save some money?</P>\n<P>Click\nhere if you’d like to know the prices of your local fuel stations\nin real-time.</P>\n<H3>Knowsher - Knowledge sharer</H3>\n<P>Would\nyou like to use an app in which you can search for abilities that you\nwant to learn in exchange for teaching something else? You don’t\nneed to pay to learn, just to teach something else in return. In case\nyou want it you can also pay a fee so you get access to it without\nhaving to teach something back.</P>\n<H2>IDEA 1: Track and recommend\ncourse prices Courselet</H2>\n<P><B>Description</B><BR><B>\n</B>Track\nthe price and receive recommendations of courses in any platform\n(Coursera, edX, Udacity, Udemy...) everything in just one place\nwithout needing to visit each platform independently, follow\ndiscounts, and more on.</P>\n<P><B>Hypothesis</B>\n <BR>Self-paced\nonline learning and education have become popular in the last couple\nof years, and with the current problems due to the pandemic, people\nare interested in finding the best cost-benefit courses of all\nplatforms in one single place. Everything from the comfort of their\nhome. \n</P>\n<P><B>Experiment\ndescription </B><BR>\n\tTo\nfind out what people think about this idea we put to the test fake\nads through bitly URLs with a specific description of the service.\nThis way we had the opportunity to discover if people would click on\nthe link to find out more about the service. This is how we would\nhave a first approximation about how feasible was our idea.\n</P>\n<P>We\nshare this link with a specific group of people so we can know how\nmany people of the total number of integrants of the group click on\nthe fake ad. \n</P>\n<P><B>Validation</B>\n<BR>We\nselected a group of people where we thought would be interested in\nthe ideas. We share the link just as if it was a normal ad. 73% of\nthe total number of people click on the link we share. \n</P>\n<P>We\ncan determine that people are interested in finding the best\ncost-benefit courses of all platforms in one single place. We cannot\nsay that people are going to consume the product yet, but at least we\ncan say they have an interest in it. \n</P>\n<P><B>Results</B>\n<BR>From\nthe data, we can determine that in fact, people are interested in\nfinding their online courses in just one place and track prices to\nget discounts. Nevertheless, we aren’t sure yet that people would\nconsistently consume our product. That’s why we should proceed with\na new approach to gather more data, we could for example create a\nvery simple prototype and see if we would use it. Then maybe another\nform could be to select a new and bigger group of people and allow\nthem to test a version of the service. \n</P>\n<H2>IDEA 2: Gas price tracker app</H2>\n<P><B>Description</B><BR><B>\n</B>This\napp will track the prices of different gas stations in the city, then\ngive you the best recommendation according to the distance and price.\nThis app will help you save money the next time that you put gas in\nyour car.  \n</P>\n<P><B>Hypothesis</B><BR><B>\n</B>The\nprices of the gas differ from each gas station. Searching for the\nbest price of the gas is nowadays an interest for the people. \n</P>\n<P><B>Experiment description</B></P>\n<p>We\n\tshared a bitly link to find out if the idea was interesting and\n\tuseful for the people. If the persons take their time to click on the\n\tlink, we could know that they are interested in acquiring the\n\tservice. This was our idea to test and confirm if our idea has true\n\tpotential for the current market. </p>\n<P>The\nlink with a brief description of the service was shared with a\nspecific group of young people, so we could know what percentage of\nthe people were interested in clicking on it. \n</P>\n<P><B>Validation</B><BR><B>\n</B>We\nselect a group of target people who could be interested in our app\nrelated to the prices of the gas stations. 73% of persons of the\ngroups showed interest in the application, clicking on the link.  \n</P>\n<P>According\nto this result, we can determine that people are interested in\ngetting lower gas prices. We don’t know the true potential of our\nproduct, but at least the premise is enough to get the genuine\ninterest of the people. \n</P>\n<P><B>Results</B><BR><B>\n</B>With\nthis data, we know that the idea is strong enough to keep going. The\nnext step is to prove which is the right interface and user\nexperience to keep the attention of the people. Creating a low budget\nprototype and doing the same type of experiment will help us to get\nthe right approach of the product. \n</P>\n<H2>IDEA 3: Knowledge exchange app</H2>\n<P><B>Hypothesis</B></P>\n<P>Learning\n\tis something that all people constantly seek. To be better people and\n\tbetter professionals, we must be constantly learning. To get a better\n\tjob we must learn new things.\n</P>\n<P>During\nthe Covid-19 pandemic, many people have been affected. Many have lost\ntheir jobs, and for those who did not have it, it has been much more\ndifficult to find one.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>The\nbest way to keep a job, get one, or even get a better one is to\nconstantly gain knowledge. Learning is the only thing that can assure\nus that at some point we can succeed.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>The\nproblem is that acquiring knowledge is not usually something\naccessible to all people, much less during a global crisis such as\nthat caused by Covid-19. That is why many people during this crisis,\neven when they were willing to dedicate time to learn, could not do\nso because they did not have the way to access quality education.</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<P>But\nit is also true that all people have something they can teach.

You do\nnot need to pay to learn just to teach something to others in return.\nIf you want, you can pay to have access without needing to teach\nanything&quot;.</P>\n<P>We\nthink that if a person clicked on the link after reading the\ndescription, they did so because they were interested in using the\napplication or at least knowing a little more about it.</P>\n<P><B>Validation</B><BR><B>\n</B>As\nwith the rest of our experiments we sent a link to some groups with\nthe premise of having access to the app, as what would be an example\nof it. The link we used was a tool that let us verify how many people\nclicked on it after some time. In this case, we were able to verify\nin a matter of hours the interest people had in our app. While our\nvalidation of the data can’t tell how it would perform in a bigger\npopulation, it gives us fast and reliable information and feedback\nwhether people are interested in the product as to click right away\nin hopes of finding the mentioned app, and this simple and fast\nprocess complies with the mindset of pretotyping, getting fast and\nconcise feedback about your product.</P>\n<P><B>Results</B><BR><B>\n</B>In\nthis case, we verified that at least 73% of the people we worked with\nfor this study were interested in the idea of the knowledge exchange\napp since that is the percentage that clicked on the link. Of course,\nwe could complement this information or increase the resources used\nto verify how the app could be tested in a more public way, though in\nthis case there were some barriers as the pandemic which\nunfortunately stops us from being able to do an in-person study.\nStill, certain tests could be applied to see how people interacted\nwith the app, but of course, there would need to be an implementation\nof it already and in this case, we just wanted to see how interesting\nit would be for a certain public, so we could fail or succeed\nquickly, to move onto the next step.</P>\n<P><BR><BR>\n</P>\n</mat-expansion-panel>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-week6',\n  templateUrl: './week6.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./week6.component.scss']\n})\nexport class Week6Component implements OnInit {\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n  }\n\n}\n","<mat-expansion-panel hideToggle class=\"ExpansionPanel\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header class=\"matPanelTitle\">\n    <mat-panel-title>\n        <p> Becoming a better developer by using the SoliD design principles by Katerina Trajchevska </p>\n        </mat-panel-title>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 6/1.png'></div><p>SoliD design principles have as purpose:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><p>To make the code more maintainable.</p>\n\t<li><p>To make it easier to quickly extend the system with new functionality\n\twithout breaking the existing ones.</p>\n\t<li><p>To make the code easier to read and understand.</p>\n</ul>\n<p>SOLiD is an acronym of the five concepts given below.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li><p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

It is a legacy that works fine for\n        small teams, but as users increment, its performance plummeted. \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Events:\n        They pick events of interest. Slack will send it through HTTP. They\n        are focused on actions (for example, clicked buttons). \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Web-API:\n        It is used to receive information from outside (another app or\n        site). \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Conversation:\n        Subsets of Web-API that calls slack directly. \n        </p>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Slack Features \n    </p>\n    <p>The slack commands work almost everywhere, channels, conversations, group conversation. \n    </p>\n    <p>Block-kit. It provides all the GUI elements. They are defined by JSON </p>\n    <p>There exist two ways of posting messages. \n    </p>\n    <ol>\n        <li><p>Incoming\n        webhook \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Using\n        chat.postMessage function \n        </p>\n    </ol>\n    <p>Incoming webhook </p>\n    <p>They are the simplest but least flexible they can generate post messages on channels. They are used via single-use URLs. They also can send notifications from other servers and read data from slack. </p>\n    <p>chat.postMessage</p>\n    <p>They call SLACK's API through HTTP. They can post everywhere and receive responses. </p>\n    <p>Ephemeralmessages </p>\n    <p>Messages in channels that only show to specific users, disappear with time. There is no guarantee that the messages reach their intended if they are not logged at the time. </p>\n    <p>Dialogs</p>\n    <p>They can only be created in response to a direct user action and supports:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><p>Single\n        line text entries \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Dropdown\n        select \n        </p>\n        <li><p>Longer\n        text area (limited to 3000 characters)</p>\n    </ul>\n</mat-expansion-panel>\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Week1Component } from './week1/week1.component';\nimport { Week2Component } from './week2/week2.component';\nimport { Week3Component } from './week3/week3.component';\nimport { Week4Component } from './week4/week4.component';\nimport { Week5Component } from './week5/week5.component';\nimport { Week6Component } from './week6/week6.component';\nimport { Week7Component } from './week7/week7.component';\nimport { Week8Component } from './week8/week8.component';\nimport { Week9Component } from './week9/week9.component';\nimport { Week10Component } from './week10/week10.component';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-weekly',\n  templateUrl: './weekly.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./weekly.component.scss']\n})\nexport class WeeklyComponent implements OnInit {\n  weeks = [\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 1\",\n      \"description\":\"From March 29th to April 2nd\",\n      \"component\":Week1Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 2\",\n      \"description\":\"From April 5th to April 9th\",\n      \"component\":Week2Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 3\",\n      \"description\":\"From April 12th to April 16th\",\n      \"component\":Week3Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 4\",\n      \"description\":\"From April 19th to April 23th\",\n      \"component\":Week4Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 5\",\n      \"description\":\"From April 26th to April 30th\",\n      \"component\":Week5Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 6\",\n      \"description\":\"From May 3rd to May 7th\",\n      \"component\":Week6Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 7\",\n      \"description\":\"From May 10th to May 14th\",\n      \"component\":Week7Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 8\",\n      \"description\":\"From May 17th to May 21th\",\n      \"component\":Week8Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 9\",\n      \"description\":\"From May 24th to May 28th\",\n      \"component\":Week9Component\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\":\"Week 10\",\n      \"description\":\"From May 31st to June 5th\",\n      \"component\":Week10Component\n    }\n  ];\n  constructor() {\n   }\n\n  ngOnInit(): void {\n    console.log();\n  }\n\n}\n","<mat-accordion>\n  <mat-expansion-panel hideToggle *ngFor=\"let week of weeks\" class=\"exP\">\n    <mat-expansion-panel-header>\n      <mat-panel-title style=\"color: white;\">{{week.name}}</mat-panel-title>\n      <mat-panel-description style=\"color: white;\">{{week.description}}</mat-panel-description>\n    </mat-expansion-panel-header>\n    <ng-container *ngComponentOutlet=\"week.component\"></ng-container>\n  </mat-expansion-panel>\n</mat-accordion>","// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.\n// `ng build --prod` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.\n// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.\n\nexport const environment = {\n  production: false\n};\n\n/*\n * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file\n * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.\n *\n * This import should be commented out in production mode because it will have a negative impact\n * on performance if an error is thrown.\n */\n// import 'zone.js/dist/zone-error';  // Included with Angular CLI.\n","import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';\nimport { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';\n\nimport { AppModule } from './app/app.module';\nimport { environment } from './environments/environment';\n\nif (environment.production) {\n  enableProdMode();\n}\n\nplatformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)\n  .catch(err => console.error(err));\n"],"sourceRoot":"webpack:///"}
