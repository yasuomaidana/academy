    <p>The problem with technology is that it is very optimized for some things, but it is fragile to other environments</p>
<p>There is more diversity on an island than on a continent</p>
<p>To enhance society's robustness, we need to remove the advantage given to the big guy.</p>

        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Our tendency of overestimating what we appreciate as good and underestimate the bad things </p>
<p>Interpretation matters because it shapes our perception and even how we could feel any event. </p>
<p>Anticipation makes us happy </p>
<p>Optimism changes reality. It could generate prophecies that could make us try harder.</p>

        <p> How do we heal medicine? | Atul Gawande </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>In the beginning, healthcare was pretty cheap because it wasn’t specialized. However, now we have several drugs and doctors focused on specific fields, which is good in a way because we can deal with complex diseases, but it makes the system more unstable to many factors, as well as increments the cost of healthcare. </p>
<p>There could be an improvement if we look at medicine as a system instead of standalone specialists.  </p>
<p>Make checklists </p>
<p>Make protocols</p>

        <p> Agile in Practice </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Pair programming means work together at the same time, even on the same computer. It is done to improve the quality of the code and to expand its knowledge of it. </p>
<p>Agile involves continuous integration. This minimizes error probability. In every iteration, the team looks to give value while interacts with others teams. These interactions ease feedback. </p>
<p>The done definition is relevant to agile management because it tells you how to measure your progress. </p>
<p>To say something is done, it should: </p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Be signed by the customer</p>
	<li><p>Have	enough acceptance criteria and assumptions 	</p>
	<li><p>Be reviewed by another developer </p>
	<li><p>Be successfully implemented </p>
	<li><p>Have	user experience test </p>
	<li><p>Have	been released in a way that won’t need further modifications 	</p>
</ul>
<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 7/2.png'></div><p>Test-driven development advantages </p>
<ul>
	<li>Ensures quality</li>
	<li>Keeps code clear, simpler and testeable</li>
	<li>Provides documentation for different team members</li>
	<li>Repeatable tests</li>
	<li>Enables rapid changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing</p>
<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 7/3.png'></div><p>Automating testing reduces risks and saves the cost of repetitive manual testing.</p>
<p>Planning poker helps you to estimate the time and effort cost of a task. When you use it, you ask your team how long an activity will take. Then you discuss the reasons. </p>
<p>Retrospectives and iterations: Everyone must have the opportunity to share their beliefs about any point. Important questions: </p>
<ul>
	<li><p>What	didn't work well? 	</p>
	<li><p> What still puzzles me? 	</p>
	<li><p>What	worked well? 	</p>
	<li><p>What	are we going to change?</p>
</ul>
<p>Success sliders allow us to know which aspects of our projects are fixed and which, more flexible to changes. These features are defined by the product owner or the sponsor.</p>
<p>To define the task's priorities, you should think in MosCoW. Must have, Could have, Would have.  </p>
<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 7/4.png'></div><p>Standing up allows us to keep fresh information about the progress and the blockers. It should be brief. It is not a micro report. The role of the manager should be focused on remove blockers. </p>
<p>The social contract is agreements made by the team, it allows the team to work safe and happy. </p>
<p>Story cards, what the users want</p>
