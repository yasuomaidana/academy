	<p>In
	software engineering, a <b>design
	pattern</b>
	is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in
	software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be
	transformed directly into code. 
	</p>
	<h2><a>Behavioral
	design patterns</a></h2>
	<p>These
	design patterns are all about Class's objects communication.
	Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically
	concerned with communication between objects.</p>
	<h3>Strategy pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Composition
		rather than inheritance</p>
	<li><p>Encapsulates
		an algorithm inside a class</p>
	<li><p>Define
		a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
		interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
		the clients that use it.</p>
	<li><p>Capture
		the abstraction in an interface, bury implementation details in
		derived classes.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/1.png'></div>	<h3>Observer</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Define
		a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
		changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
		automatically.</p>
	<li><p>Encapsulate
		the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction,
		and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an
		Observer hierarchy.</p>
	<li><p>The
		&quot;View&quot; part of Model-View-Controller.</p>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	<li><p>Define
		the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps
		to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine
		certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's
		structure.</p>
	<li><p>Base
		class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes
		implement the placeholders.</p>
	<li><p><b>Template
		Method</b>
		is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an
		algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific
		steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/5.png'></div>	<h3>Iterator Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Provide
		a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
		without exposing its underlying representation.</p>
	<li><p>The
		C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible to
		decouple collection classes and algorithms.</p>
	<li><p>Promote
		to &quot;full object status&quot; the traversal of a collection.</p>
	<li><p>Polymorphic
		traversal</p>
	<li><p><b>Iterator</b>
		is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a
		collection without exposing its underlying representation (list,
		stack, tree, etc.).</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/6.png'></div>	<h3>State Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Allow
		an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The
		object will appear to change its class.</p>
	<li><p>An
		object-oriented state machine</p>
	<li><p>wrapper
		+ polymorphic wrappee + collaboration</p>
	<li><p><b>State</b>
		is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its
		behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the
		object changed its class.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/7.png'></div>		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/8.png'></div>	<h3>Null Object Design Pattern</h3>
	<p>The
	intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by
	providing a substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do
	nothing behavior. In short, a design where &quot;nothing will come of
	nothing&quot;</p>
	<p>Use
	the Null Object pattern when</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>an
		object requires a collaborator. The Null Object pattern does not
		introduce this collaboration--it makes use of a collaboration that
		already exists</p>
	<li><p>some
		collaborator instances should do nothing</p>
	<li><p>you
		want to abstract the handling of null away from the client</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/9.png'></div>	<h2><a>Structural
	design patterns</a></h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>These
		design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.
		Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose
		interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose
		objects to obtain new functionality.</p>
	<li><p>These
		patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger
		structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.</p>
	<li><p>Structural
		patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger
		structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3><a>Decorator</a></h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Add
		responsibilities to objects dynamically</p>
	<li><p><b>Decorator</b>
		is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to
		objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that
		contain the behaviors.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/10.png'></div>	<h3>Adapter Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Convert
		the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
		Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because
		of incompatible interfaces.</p>
	<li><p>Wrap
		an existing class with a new interface.</p>
	<li><p>Impedance
		match an old component to a new system</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/11.png'></div>	<h3>Facade Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Provide
		a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade
		defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to
		use.</p>
	<li><p>Wrap
		a complicated subsystem with a simpler interface.</p>
	<li><p><b>Facade</b>
		is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface
		to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/12.png'></div>	<h3>Proxy Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Provide
		a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to
		it.</p>
	<li><p>Use
		an extra level of indirection to support distributed, controlled, or
		intelligent access.</p>
	<li><p>Add
		a wrapper and delegation to protect the real component from undue
		complexity.</p>
	<li><p><b>Proxy</b>
		is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or
		placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the
		original object, allowing you to perform something either before or
		after the request gets through to the original object.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/13.png'></div>	<h3>Bridge Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Decouple
		an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
		independently.</p>
	<li><p>Publish
		interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury implementation in
		its own inheritance hierarchy.</p>
	<li><p>Beyond
		encapsulation, to insulation</p>
	<li><p><b>Bridge</b>
		is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or
		a set of closely related classes into two separate
		hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be
		developed independently of each other.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/14.png'></div>	<h3>Composite Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Compose
		objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.
		Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of
		objects uniformly.</p>
	<li><p>Recursive
		composition</p>
	<li><p>&quot;Directories
		contain entries, each of which could be a directory.&quot;</p>
	<li><p>1-to-many
		&quot;has a&quot; up the &quot;is a&quot; hierarchy</p>
	<li><p><b>Composite</b>
		is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into
		tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were
		individual objects.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/15.png'></div>		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/16.png'></div>	<h2>Creational design patterns</h2>
	<p>Creational
	design patterns are concerned with<b>
	the way of creating objects.</b>
	These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the
	time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a
	class).</p>
	<h3>Factory Method Pattern</h3>
	<p>A
	Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just <b>define
	an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the
	subclasses decide which class to instantiate.</b>
	In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of
	the class.</p>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/17.png'></div>	<h3>Abstract Factory Design
	Pattern</h3>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/18.png'></div>	<ul>
	<li><p>Provide
		an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
		without specifying their concrete classes.</p>
	<li><p>A
		hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible &quot;platforms&quot;,
		and the construction of a suite of &quot;products&quot;.</p>
	<li><p>The
		new operator considered harmful.</p>
	<li><p><b>Factory
		Method</b>
		is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for
		creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the
		type of objects that will be created.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/19.png'></div>	<h3>Singleton Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Ensure
		a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access
		to it.</p>
	<li><p>Encapsulated
		&quot;just-in-time initialization&quot; or &quot;initialization on
		first use&quot;.</p>
	<li><p><b>Singleton</b>
		is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has
		only one instance, while providing a global access point to this
		instance.</p>
	</ul>
		<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 14/20.png'></div>	<h3>Command Design Pattern</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Encapsulate
		a request as an object, thereby letting you parametrize clients with
		different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
		operations.</p>
	<li><p>Promote
		&quot;invocation of a method on an object&quot; to full object
		status</p>
	<li><p>An
		object-oriented callback</p>
	<li><p><b>Command</b>
		is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a
		stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
		This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments,
		delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable
		operations.</p>
	</ul>

        <p> Dependency in java </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    		<p>Dependency
	injection (DI) is the concept in which objects get other required
	objects from outside.</p>
	<p>A
	Java class has a dependency on another class, if it uses an instance
	of this class. We call this a <i>class</i>
	dependency. For example, a class which accesses a logger service has
	a dependency on this service class.</p>

        <p> JavaScript - Difference Between =, == And === In JavaScript </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    		<ul>
	<li><p>=
		is used for assigning values to a variable in JavaScript.</p>
	<li><p>==
		is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the
		datatype of variable.</p>
	<li><p>===
		is used for comparison between two variables but this will check
		strict type, which means it will check datatype and compare two
		values.</p>
	</ul>
	<h2>Why use = in JavaScript?</h2>
	<p>Here
	are the important uses of = in JavaScript:</p>
	<p>=
	JavaScript operator assigns a value to the left operand depends on
	the value of operand available on the right side. The first operand
	should be a variable.</p>
	<p>The
	basic assignment operator is =, that assigns the value of one operand
	to another. That is, a = b assigns the value of b to a.</p>
	<h2>Why use == in JavaScript?</h2>
	<p>Here
	are the important uses of == in JavaScript:</p>
	<p>The
	== operator is an equality operator. It checks whether its two
	operands are the same or not by changing expression from one data
	type to others. You can use == operator in order to compare the
	identity of two operands even though, they are not of a similar type.</p>
	<h2>How === Works Exactly?</h2>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Strict
		equality === checks that two values are the same or not.</p>
	<li><p>Value
		are not implicitly converted to some other value before comparison.</p>
	<li><p>If
		the variable values are of different types, then the values are
		considered as unequal.</p>
	<li><p>If
		the variable are of the same type, are not numeric, and have the
		same value, they are considered as equal.</p>
	<li><p>Lastly,
		If both variable values are numbers, they are considered equal if
		both are not NaN (Not a Number) and are the same value.</p>
	</ul>
	<p><br><br>
