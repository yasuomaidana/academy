        <p> Becoming a better developer by using the SoliD design principles by Katerina Trajchevska </p>
        </mat-panel-title>

    <div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 6/1.png'></div><p>SoliD design principles have as purpose:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>To make the code more maintainable.</p>
	<li><p>To make it easier to quickly extend the system with new functionality
	without breaking the existing ones.</p>
	<li><p>To make the code easier to read and understand.</p>
</ul>
<p>SOLiD is an acronym of the five concepts given below.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). A class should be responsible for	ONE thing.</p>
	<li><p>Open/Closed	Principle.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>An entity should be open for extension but closed for modification.		</p>
		<li><p>Extend functionality by adding new code instead of changing existing code.</p>
		<li><p>Separate the behaviors, so the system can easily be extended but never broken.</p>
		<li><p>Goal: get to a point where you can never break the core of your system.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Liskov's	Substitution Priciple (LSP)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Any derived class should be able to substitute its parent class without the consumer knowing it.</p>
		<li><p>Every class that implements an interface must be able to substitute any reference throughout the code that implements that same interface.</p>
		<li><p>Every part of the code should get the expected result no matter what	instance of a class you send to it, given it implements the same interface.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>A client should never be forced to depend on methods it does not use or, a client should never depend on anything more than the method it is calling.</p>
		<li><p>Changing	one method in a class should not affect classes that do not depend on</p>
		<li><p>Replace fat interfaces with many small, specific interfaces.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Never depend on anything concrete, only on abstractions.</p>
		<li><p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. They should depend on abstractions.</p>
		<li><p>Able	to change an implementation easily without altering the high-level code.</p>
	</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>SoliD design principles are principles, not rules.</p>
	<li><p>Always use common sense when applying SoliD.</p>
	<li><p>Avoid over-fragmenting your code for the sake of SRP or SoliD.</p>
	<li><p>Don't try to achieve SoliD, use SoliD to achieve maintainability.</p>
	<li><p>The purpose of SoliD principles is to make your code more maintainable, easy to extend, and reason about.</p>
	<li><p>It requires spending more time writing code, so you can spend less reading it later.</p>
	<li><p>SoliD principles are principles, not rules.</p>
	<li><p>Always know your trade-offs and use common sense.</p>
	<li><p>SoliD is your tool, not your goal.</p>

        <p> Analysis of Algorithms | Big-O analysis </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>This asymptotic notation is used to measure and compare the worst-case scenarios of algorithms theoretically. For any algorithm, the Big-O analysis should be straightforward as long as we correctly identify the operations that are dependent on n, the input size.</p>
<div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 6/2.png'></div><h2>Space-Time Tradeoff and Efficiency</h2>
<p>There is usually a trade-off between optimal memory use and runtime performance. </p>
<p>In general for an algorithm, space efficiency and time efficiency reach two opposite ends and each point in between them has a certain time and space efficiency. So, the more time efficiency you have, the less space efficiency you have and vice versa. </p>

        <p> Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept in Java </p>
        </mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <div class='images'><img src='assets/Week 6/3.png'></div><p>The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-java/">Polymorphism</a><b>:</b>
	Polymorphism refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to
	differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently.</p>
	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-java/">Inheritance</a><b>:</b>
	It is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the
	features(fields and methods) of another class.Important
	terminology:</p>
</ol>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>Super
		Class: </b>The
		class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or a base
		class or a parent class).</p>
		<li><p><b>Sub
		Class:</b>
		The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a
		derived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can
		add its fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and
		methods.</p>
		<li><p><b>Reusability:</b>
		Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we
		want to create a new class and there is already a class that
		includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class
		from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields
		and methods of the existing class.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<ol START=3>
	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encapsulation-in-java/">Encapsulation</a><b>:</b>
	Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single
	unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it
	manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a
	protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the
	code outside this shield.</p>
</ol>
<ol>
	<ol TYPE=a>
		<li><p>Technically
		in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from
		any other class and can be accessed only through any member
		function of its class in which they are declared.</p>
		<li><p>As
		in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes,
		so it is also known as <b>data-hiding</b>.</p>
		<li><p>Encapsulation
		can be achieved by <b>Declaring</b>
		all the variables in the class as <b>private</b>
		and writing public <b>methods</b>
		in the class to <b>set</b>
		and <b>get</b>
		the values of variables.</p>

	details are displayed to the user.</p>
	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/">Class</a><b>:</b>
	A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects
	are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are
	common to all objects of one type. In general, class declarations
	can include these components, in order:</p>
</ol>
<ol>

	<ol TYPE=a>
		<li><p><b>Class
		name:</b>
		The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by
		convention).</p>
		<li><p><b>Superclass(if

		The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by
		the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.</p>
		<li><p><b>Interfaces(if
		any):</b>
		A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if

	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/classes-objects-java/">Object</a><b>:</b>
	It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents
	real-life entities. A typical Java program creates many objects,
	which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists
	of:</p>
</ol>
<ol>
	<ol TYPE=a>
		<li><p><b>State</b>:
		It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the
		properties of an object.</p>
		<li><p><b>Behavior</b>:
		It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the
		response of an object with other objects.</p>
		<li><p><b>Identity</b>:
		It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to
		interact with other objects.</p>
	</ol>
</ol>
<ol START=7>
	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/methods-in-java/">Method</a><b>:</b>
	A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific
	task and return (or not) results to the caller. Methods allow us to
	<b>reuse</b>
	the code without retyping the code.</p>
	<li><p>
	Components:</p>

<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p><b>public:</b>
		accessible in all classes in your application.</p>
		<li><p><b>protected:</b>
		accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its

		<li><p><b>Method
		Name</b>:
		the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the
		convention is a little different.</p>
		<li><p><b>Parameter
		list</b>:
		Comma-separated list of the input parameters is defined, preceded
		with their data type, within the enclosed parenthesis. If there are
		no parameters, you must use empty parentheses ().</p>
		<li><p><b>Exception
		list</b>:
		The exceptions you expect by the method can throw, you can specify

	<li><p><a HREF="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/message-passing-in-java/">Message
	Passing</a><b>:</b>
	Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving
	information from each other. A message for an object is a request
	for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in
	the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message
	passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the
	function, and the information to be sent</p>
